# KoinX Backend Internship Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the **KoinX Backend Internship Assignment**. The project is built using **Node.js** and demonstrates my ability to create a robust backend system by implementing several tasks, including a feature to fetch the market chart of the last 30 days for a cryptocurrency.

## Features

### âœ… **Task Implementation**

1. **Fetch Price of a Cryptocurrency**Retrieve the current price of a specific cryptocurrency from the market.
2. **Track Price of a Cryptocurrency**Set up a mechanism to track the price of a cryptocurrency at regular intervals.
3. **Notify on Price Changes**Send notifications when the price of a cryptocurrency changes significantly.
4. **Market Chart of the Last 30 Days**
   Fetch and display the market chart of a cryptocurrency for the past 30 days.

### ðŸš€ **Why I Used These Technologies**

- **Node.js**Node.js is a fast and efficient runtime environment for building scalable and high-performance backend systems. Its asynchronous nature is well-suited for handling APIs and real-time operations like tracking cryptocurrency prices.
- **node-cron**
  I used `node-cron` to schedule recurring tasks, such as fetching cryptocurrency data at specified intervals. It simplifies the process of setting up cron jobs and is highly reliable for backend automation.
